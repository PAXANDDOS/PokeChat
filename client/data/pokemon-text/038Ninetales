All Ninetales have the ability Flash Fire, which powers up its Fire-type moves if it is hit by a Fire-type attack. It also grants immunity from Fire attacks. This does not apply to Dream World Ninetales, who instead possess the ability Drought, creating a permanent Sunny effect for the duration of the battle or until another weather-altering move or ability is used.
