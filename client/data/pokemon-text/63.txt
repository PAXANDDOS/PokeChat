Absol has a dark blue face with a short, cat-like muzzle, a small, black, triangular nose, a scythe-like tail, and sickle-shaped growth on the right side of its head. Like owls, it seems to have one ear point upward and one point downward, supposedly to hear the exact location a sound is coming from. It also has an oval marking on the top of its head.
