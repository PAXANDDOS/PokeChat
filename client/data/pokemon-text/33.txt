Leafeon is a quadruped mammalian whose most distinguishing features are its lithe body structure and vegetation protruding from its body. Its tail and ears are stylized to resemble torn and tattered leaves. Besides the leaf-like ears and tail, there are a multitude of smaller leaves growing from its body; leaves grow out from the knee joint areas on the forelegs and hind legs.
