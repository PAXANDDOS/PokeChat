Corsola is composed of a pink and white, coral-like substance. It has a small face with a smile and a white underbelly. In addition to the coral outgrowths (also described as branches) situated all over the upper half of its body, Corsola also has a growth like a horn on its head, and that is considered its natural armament when facing underwater predators.
