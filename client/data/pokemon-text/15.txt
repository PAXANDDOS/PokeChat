Ponyta is very weak at birth, so weak that it can barely stand up. This Pok√©mon however becomes stronger by stumbling and falling to keep up with its parent. It is known to run fast and jump high. It allows humans to ride on its back occasionally. However, if angered, it may choose to burn its rider by igniting its back. Although its mane is made of flames, it will never burn a trainer it trusts.
