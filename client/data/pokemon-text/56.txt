Psyduck is a medium-sized, yellow platypus-like or duck-like Pok√©mon. Only the feet and bill are tan. The other body parts are all yellow. Psyduck has three black hairs on top of its head, and its hands are always on its head due to its constant headache.Psyduck always hold their heads due to the fact that they have a near-constant headache. This makes them seem like they are unintelligent, when in fact they are quite clever and wily.
