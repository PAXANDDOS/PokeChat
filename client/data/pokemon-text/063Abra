It has been known to sleep 18 hours a day, as it needs its rest for its telekinetic abilities. Abra also can teleport away from danger by the means of using the move Teleport. It can even perform this technique while asleep. If it doesn't get enough sleep, its powers fade.
Abra evolves into Kadabra at level 16 and then into Alakazam via trading.
