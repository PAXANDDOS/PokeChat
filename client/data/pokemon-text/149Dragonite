Most Dragonite are very friendly as well as selfless and will rescue anyone lost at sea. However, as shown in one episode, they will go on a rampage if their environment is harmed. They tend to battle Kingdra, their sworn rivals, in the wild. Dragonite are very rarely found near water bodies. Some claim that there is an island where only they live, which has only been seen only once.
