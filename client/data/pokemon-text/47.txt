Slowking is a bipedal Pok√©mon with a backward facing Shellder latched onto its head. It is primarily pink, with a pale yellow muzzle and scaled belly. Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The backward facing Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder.
