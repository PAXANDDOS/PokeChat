Piplup is a chubby, light-blue penguin-like Pok√©mon, which is covered in thick down (and, presumably, given its plump appearance and real-world penguin biology, thick layers of fatty tissue) to insulate against the cold. It has a dark blue head with a primarily white face and a short, yellow beak. The dark blue feathers on its head extend down its back and around its neck, which causes it to appear to be wearing a cape.
