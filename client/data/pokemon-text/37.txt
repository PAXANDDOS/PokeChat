Meltan is a small Pokémon with a gold head, which resembles a hex nut, and a glossy silver body. A black sphere floats in the center of Meltan's head like a magnet; the sphere itself is Meltan's eye. A red cable sticks out from Meltan's back, acting as a tail. Its hex nut head can also spin and it is revealed to be the primary source of Meltan’s eye power.
