Shellder can have the ability Shell Armor or the ability Skill Link. Shell Armor prevents Shellder's opponents from getting a Critical Hit on Shellder. Skill Link increases the frequency of multi-hitting attacks. As a last resort, Shellder clamps on to its opponents. It swims backward by opening and closing its two shells.
