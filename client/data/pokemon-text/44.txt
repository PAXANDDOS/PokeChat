Cacturne is based on a combination of a cactus and a scarecrow. Its face resembles a jack-'o-lantern, while its hat, green color, and Dark-type may be a reference to the Moomin franchise's (as it's popular in Japan) Snufkin, a humanoid character with a love of nature and extreme hatred for any sort of authority or leadership, leading him to do dangerous and even criminal things to people in positions of authority.
