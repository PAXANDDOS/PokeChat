Milotic is an elegant, sinuous Pokémon that resembles a sea serpent or oarfish. Its body is predominantly cream in color, while its fanlike tail comes in various shades (particularly of blue and magenta), that change upon the viewing angle. It has long red "hair" and curled red eyebrows that embellish its crimson eyes. Milotic is thought to be one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the world.
