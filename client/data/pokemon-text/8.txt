Pidgeot resembles a large, feathery bird with huge wings. It has a brightly colored crest and tail. Many trainers are drawn to Pidgeot because of its lovely feathers. The beautiful colors of its crest are particularly striking. It is easily confused with Pidgeotto because the only difference without a relative size comparison is that Pigeot's tail and crest coloring switch from those of Pidgeotto's.
