Bulbasaur resembles a small amphibian, but bears three claws on each of its feet and has no tail. It also has large, red eyes and small, sharp teeth. Its skin is a light, turquoise color with dark, green spots. It has three claws on all four of its legs. Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which according to its entry in the Pok√©dex, was planted there at birth.
