Espeon is a quadruped mammalian Pok√©mon with a cat-like appearance. Sleek and lilac/lavender purple fur covers its body. It has a red jewel encrusted on its forehead; this jewel glows whenever Espeon uses its Psychic abilities. Its face is distinctly cat-like with a short, blunt muzzle and a tiny, triangular nose.
