Froslass made her debut appearance in The Drifting Snorunt!. She appears to Ash and his friends while they are traveling through a snowstorm. She creates an illusion to lure them into a trap so that they help find her lost friend, Snorunt. In A Real Rival Rouser, Paul used a Froslass against Ash in the Sinnoh League, but was quickly defeated by his Pikachu.
