Slowpoke is a mostly pink Pok√©mon. It stands on four legs, and has a long tail that is used like a fishing pole. Its mouth is a pale brown color.

Galarian Slowpoke's appearance is a result of particles being built from eating Galarica seeds. The main difference is that it has gained yellow markings on its forehead and tail.
