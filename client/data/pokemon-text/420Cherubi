Cherubi is a small, pink Pok√©mon that resembles a cherry, hence its name. Cherubi has a smaller berry attached to it, that helps it grow. Cherubi's body has a single dark line running over the middle of its head and two, stubby pointed legs. The smaller cherry's eyes appear closed. It is said that when the berry wilts, evolution is near.
