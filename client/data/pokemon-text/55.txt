Meowth is a small, bipedal, feline Pok√©mon. It has two cream whiskers on each side of its oval-shaped face and two hairs sticking up on either side of the coin-like gem on its forehead. Meowth also has a curled tail. Meowth's tail and feet are cream-colored like the rest of it, but they are brown at the end. It has small paw pads on the undersides of its heels and toes. It is much like a Maneki Neko, a toy of Japanese descent known for bobbing its arm and hand up and down.
