Voltorb is based off of a Pok√© Ball. In a meta sense, it may be based off of the "mimic enemy" archetype common in video games, where an enemy disguises itself as a useful item to lure players into combat. Its round shape and tendency to self destruct may make it based on a bomb. It may also be based on the Tsukumogami species of yokai, inanimate objects that gain a spirit/sentience upon their 100th year of existence.
